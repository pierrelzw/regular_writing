# Scarcity

Those with some familiarity with economic thoery are likely to understand 'scarcity' in its iterms. In that context, something is scarce if its price is greater than zero. By this definition, land if scarce-it costs a lot of money to buy a piece of land. And financial capital is still because even with our current low interest rates, there is a price for borrowing money or raising equity.
