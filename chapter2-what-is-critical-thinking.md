# CHAPTER 2 What Is Critical Thinking?
When Arthur was in the first grade, the teacher directed the class to “think.” “Now, class,” she said, “I know this problem is a little harder than the ones we’ve been doing, but I’m going to give you a few extra minutes to think about it. Now start thinking.”
> 阿瑟上一年级的时候，老师指导全班同学 "思考"。"现在，同学们，"她说，"我知道这个问题比我们做的那些问题要难一点，但我要给你们额外的几分钟时间来思考它。现在，开始思考。"

It was not the first time Arthur had heard the word used. He’d heard it many times at home, but never quite this way. The teacher seemed to be asking for some special activity, something he should know how to start and stop—like his father’s car. “Vroom-m-m,” he muttered half aloud. Because of his confusion, he was unaware he was making the noise.
> 这并不是亚瑟第一次听到这个词。他在家里听到过很多次，但从来不像现在这样。老师似乎在要求他们做一些特殊的事情——他应该知道如何开始和停止的东西，就像他父亲的汽车。"Vroom-m-m，"他用平时一般的音量发出类似的声音。由于他陷在困惑里，他没有意识到自己在发出这种声音。

“Arthur, please stop making noises and start thinking.”
> "阿瑟，请不要再发出声音，开始思考。"

Embarrassed and not knowing quite what to do, he looked down at his desk. Then, out of the corner of his eye, he noticed that the little girl next to him was staring at the ceiling. “Maybe that’s the way you start thinking,” he guessed. He decided the others had probably learned how to do it last year, that time he was home with the measles. So he stared at the ceiling.
> 他很尴尬，但是不知道该怎么做，他低头看了看自己的桌子。然后，从眼角的余光中，他注意到他旁边的小女孩正盯着天花板。"也许这就是你开始思考的方式，"他猜测道。他怀疑其他人可能去年就已经学会了，那次他出麻疹在家的时候。所以他也盯着天花板看。

As he progressed through grade school and high school, he heard that same direction hundreds of times. “No, that’s not the answer, you’re not thinking—now think!” And occasionally he would hear from particularly self-pitying teachers given to muttering to themselves aloud: “What did I do to deserve this? Don’t they teach them anything in the grades anymore? Don’t you people care about ideas? Think, dammit, THINK.”
> 随着他在从小学升学上了高中，他听到了几百次类似的话。"不，这不是答案，你没有在思考。现在，开始思考！" 偶尔他也会听到一些特别自怜的老师大声地自言自语。"我到底做了什么才会这样？难道他们在小学的时候里不教这些孩子任何东西了吗？你们这些人难道不关心思想吗？思考，该死的，思考"。

So Arthur learned to feel somewhat guilty about the whole matter. Obviously, this thinking was an important activity that he’d failed to learn. Maybe he lacked the brain power. But he was resourceful enough. He watched the other students and did what they did. Whenever a teacher started in about thinking, he screwed up his face, furrowed his brow, scratched his head, stroked his chin, stared off into space or up at the ceiling, and repeated silently to himself, “Let’s see now, I’ve got to think about that, think, think—I hope he doesn’t call on me—think.”
> 因此，阿瑟学会了对整个事情感到有些愧疚。显然，他没能学会这种“重要"的思考方式。也许他的大脑缺乏能量。但他足够机智。他观察着其他学生，学习他们的做法。每当老师开始讲思考的时候，他就把自己的脸挤成一团，皱起眉头，挠挠头，摸摸下巴，盯着太空或天花板，默默地对自己说："让我来思考，我得思考，思考，我希望他不要叫我，思考……"

Though Arthur didn’t know it, that’s just what the other students were saying to themselves.
> Arthur不知道，其他学生脑子里想的其实和他一样。

Your experience may have been similar to Arthur’s. In other words, many people may have simply told you to think without ever explaining what thinking is and what qualities a good thinker has that a poor thinker lacks. If that is the case, you have a lot of company. Extensive, effective training in thinking is the exception rather than the rule. This fact and its unfortunate consequences are suggested by the following comments from accomplished observers of the human condition:
> 你的经历可能与亚瑟的类似。换句话说，许多人可能只是告诉你要思考，却从未解释过什么是思考，以及什么品质是一个好的思考者具有的，而一个差的思考者却缺乏的。如果你也是这样的话，你并不孤独。广泛而有效的思维训练是罕见的。这一事实及其不幸的后果是由以下对人类状况有成就的观察家的评论所暗示的。
The most interesting and astounding contradiction in life is to me the con- stant insistence by nearly all people upon “logic,” “logical reasoning,” “sound reasoning,” on the one hand, and on the other their inability to display it, and their unwillingness to accept it when displayed by others.

Mental indolence is one of the commonest of human traits.
What is this activity that everyone claims is important but few people have mastered? Thinking is a general term used to cover numerous activ- ities, from daydreaming to reflection and analysis. Here are just some of the synonyms listed in Roget’s Thesaurus for think:
All of those are just the names that thinking goes under. They really don’t explain it. The fact is, after thousands of years of humans’ experi- encing thought and talking and writing about thinking, it remains in many respects one of the great mysteries of our existence. Still, though much is yet to be learned, a great deal is already known.
