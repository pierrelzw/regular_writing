“警告”、“前言”和“1.1 定投策略及其效果展示” 

1. **什么是定投策略？**

   A strategy of **regular investing** is the simplest way to practice investing, as all you have to do is regularly purchase a set investment over the long term. 

   

   Regular investing is quite simple:

   > Regularly invest a set amount in a particular investment over a long period of time.

   

2. **为什么定投策略哪怕是在最坏的情况入场都能提前盈利？**

   数据不会说谎，让我们用事实证明。

   Suppose you started investing in the S&P 500 on October 8th, 2007. Knowing what we know now, that seems to be the worst time to enter the market, because what immediately followed was the 2008 financial crisis, and it was that day that the stock market began to crash. So if you started investing $1,000 USD per week on that day...

   What would the result be? Back on October 8th, 2007, it would be really hard to say. But looking at it from today, more than a decade later, the answer is clear: the results were fantastic! We experienced a crash in the market from $1,561 to a low of $683, but we kept buying at that low price. Later, the market recovered, and by October of 2019 the S&P 500 had exceeded $2,960.

   But this description is missing an important detail. The chart below shows the value of your total assets (the red line) and the value of your total investment (the blue line).

   But if you take another look at the chart above, you'll see that the red line crosses the blue line for the first time in 2009. So while it took the S&P 500 **286** weeks to return to its high, your strategy of regular investing began to see steadily positive returns after just *111* weeks. When you started to see positive returns, the S&P 500 was still 30% off its all-time high. When the S&P 500 finally returned to its high after 286 weeks, your strategy was already showing returns of *32.64%*.

   Let's take a look at an even more striking example. Suppose you started regularly investing in Bitcoin in December of 2017, when Bitcoin was at it's all-time high of $19,800. Shortly afterwards, the price crashed, and it still hasn't returned to its all-time high. The chart below assumes you started regularly investing in Bitcoin on December 11th, 2017, and kept it up for 87 weeks.

   Even though you entered the market at the worst time, your investment has still been profitable in USD terms, with the red line (your assets in USD terms) passing the blue line (your total investment in USD terms) on May 6th, 2019. If you invested $100 each week, by the 87th week you would have invested $8,700, but your Bitcoin would have been worth $16,417, for a gain of **88.71%**. This is despite the fact that Bitcoin remained 62.85% off of it's all-time high, which was when you started investing.

> **Bear markets are much longer than bull markets.**

> With regular investing, **your profits essentially all come from the bear market!**



2. **你对定投自己有什么想法？**

> Solving the single most important problem can directly avoid the problems that so many others face.

解决最根本的问题，可以让避免绝大多数人遇到的问题。

在重要的人生问题上，投资、身体健康、亲密关系，我都在或都将采用定策略。

投资：我用定投策略管理80%的以上的投资资金

身体健康：我每天骑车上下班，总计1h。

亲密关系：前段时间，女友和我说：“我们似乎很久没有吵架了，上一次吵可能是1年多以前了”。我没有意识到，但是回想起来，极有可能是因为我们受笑来老师思想的影响。过去我很关注自己，希望有自己的独立空间和时间。现在，我会把陪伴家人、伴侣放在比较高的优先级上。结果，很多问题自然而然就解决了。我要的私人空间进而也很容易找到。
