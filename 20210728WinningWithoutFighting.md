**3.1 屡战屡败不战则胜**

1. **观点：定投策略是一种不战而胜的策略**

2. **可能有歧义的概念：**

- 定投策略，在两个大周期内持续定投，只有一个动作——买
- 不战：因为定投者只有一个动作——买，所以他们无需
- 胜：在投资中获得收益，超过一般人的收益

3. **作者给出的理由：**

- 定投者只有一个动作——买，所以理论上只要严格遵守，就没有犯错的机会。到时候了就买，就完了。
- 频繁交易者，追求低买高卖，然而市场短期是随机的，所以他们只有50%的机会能够真正低卖，也只有50%的机会能够低卖，所以他们能做到“低买高卖”的机会只有50%x50%=25%
- 频繁交易者，做的是之后判断，所以，他们以为自己低买高卖成功了。事实上，他们只拿到了当时涨幅的1/3。
- 还有呢，价格除了上涨和下跌，还有可能保持不变！所以事实上，频繁交易者成功的概率，只有1/3x1/3=11.11%
- 更糟糕的是，非定投策略采用者，不止是频繁交易这一个多余的动作，他们还会不停的更换标的。甚至，他们还会尝试不同的投资策略。相比这些带来的损失，巴菲特所说的因为频繁交带来的交易手续费，根本不算什么。
- 数据表明，频繁交易者因为频繁交易带来的损失为每年2%。不要小看2%，30年来看，2%就是45%的损失！

4. **这些理由可以推理出“定投策略采用者不战而胜”的结论么？**

   可以。

   简单来说，定投策略采用者，只有一个动作，所以可以不犯错。但是，频繁交易者几乎一切动作都会让他们犯错，进而导致损失。

>  **the power of regular investing comes precisely from the fact that it only involves doing one thing**. This is because doing only one thing means that regular investors have no room to make mistakes by doing other things, which ensures that *gamma* is 0.

​	只有一个动作——买，这样理论上可以保证几乎不出错。

> They just added one thing (trying to buy low and sell high), and their chances of success have dropped from 100% to 25%.

>  Once you understand that short-term price movements are an unpredictable ["random walk"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk_hypothesis), you will understand why the chances of success are really 50% x 50% = 25%. No more no less.

> Frequent traders don't understand that what they are depending on is **judgement after the fact**.

> Another detail that must be considered is that the chance of guessing right is actually much lower than 50%, because in addition to **going up** or **going down**, the price could **stay the same**

> Even for the 25% of the time that they are right twice in a row, they actually only make about a third of the profit that they think they should. 

> they have tons of things that they try to do! For instance, not only do they trade frequently over the short term, they also switch between different investments.

> frequent traders will likely have a *gamma* of at least 2%, whereas, had they just bought and held, their *gamma* would have been 0. 

> regular investing is the best strategy for **winning without fighting**.
