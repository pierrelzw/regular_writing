**4.3 长期教育与镜像效应**

1. 请举例你能观察到的身边的“镜像效应”？

   - 写代码的时候，先思考方案，拟出框架，再动手写代码。短期来看，很费时，长期看（其实也不用很长，简单的代码1-2天），其实是更快速的方法。
   - 写代码的时候，多写一些评论：短期看，费时费力，降低开发效率；长期看，能够帮助自己或别人在未来快速回溯，捡起自己的代码，其实是更高效率的做法
   - 写代码的时候，仔细思考命名，让函数更容易理解：短期看，费时费力，降低开发效率；长期看，能够让代码更易理解，更易维护升级，是更高效率的做法。

   文中的一个镜像效应案例：

   This is the secret of investment: have a 100% objective understanding of the objective world, and a 100% objective understanding of oneself. It's really very difficult. It's only difficult, though, from the perspective of the present, and it's certainly not impossible. Looked at from a long-term perspective, it shouldn't be difficult at all.

2. 发现这些“镜像效应”后你要怎么做？

   戴上长期主义的眼镜，思考长期主义者会在镜子的那一侧

3. 你将如何通过练习锻炼自己看清楚“镜像效应”的能力？

   一种获得培养长期主义的方法：

   When you read this book again, I suggest that you keep a list in a notebook of all the examples of the Mirror Effect. In the years to come, you can add to this list as you come across new examples. As you go through this process, you will discover that these sunglasses will slowly become invisible, and you may not even need the sunglasses anymore, because the ability to think long-term will become a natural function of your eyes.

4. 你印象深刻的⼀句话是哪句话？

   Almoost all of the surprising Mirror Effects are due to differenct understanding of the long term.

   The more people there are who expect that the market will be efficient in the short term the better, because that's the only way you can have a relative advantage.

   > The more important the problem the easier it is to solve, and the hardest problems are the easiest to solve. But people waste all of their wisdom trying to solve complicated yet unimportant problems.

   We either focus fully on the present, or we focus fully on the future.
