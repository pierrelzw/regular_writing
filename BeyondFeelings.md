## Chapter 1 Who Are You?

### The Influence of Time and Space

**Not only are you a member of a particular species, Homo sapiens, but you also exist at a particular time in the history of that species and in a particular place on the planet.** That time and place are defined by specific circumstances, understandings, beliefs, and customs, all of which limit your experience and influence yout thought patterns, If you had lived in America in *colonial* times, you likely would have had no objection to the practice of barring women for serving on a jury, entering into a legal contract, owning property, or voting. If you had lived in the nineteenth century, you would have had no objection to young children being denied and education and being hired out by their parents to work sixteen hours a day, nor would you have given any thought to the specical needs of adolescence. (The concept of a adolecence was not invented until 1904.)

If you had been raised in the Middle East, you would stand much closer to people you converse with then you do in America, If you had beed raised in India, you might be perfectly comfortable having your parents choose your spouse for you. If your native language were Spanish and your knowledge of English modest, you probably would be confused by some English colloquialisms. James Henslin offfers two amusing examples of such confusion: Chevrolet Novas initially sold very poorly in Mexico because no va in Spanish means "it doesn't work"; and Perdue chickens were regarded with a certain suspicion(or worse) because the company's slogan--"It takes a tough man to make a tender chicken"--became in Spanish "It takes an aroused man to make a chicken affectionate."

People who grow up in Europe, Asia, or South America have very different ideas of  punctuality. As Daniel Goleman explains, "Five minutes is late but permissible for a business appointment int he U.S., but thirty minutes is normal in Arab contries. In England five to fifteen minutes is the 'correct' lateness for one invited to dinner; an Italian might come two hours late, an Ethiopian still later, a Javenese not at all, haveing accepted only to prevent his host's losing fave." **A difference ethnic origin would also mean different tastes in food**. Instead of craving a New York Strip steak and french fries, you might crave "raw monkey brains" or "camel's milk cheese patties cured in dry camel's dung" and washed down with "warm camel's blood." Sociologist Ian Roberston summed up to the range of global dietary differences succinctly: "Americans eat oysters but not snails. The French eat snails but not locusts. The zulus eat locusts but not fish. The Jews eat fish but not pork. The Hindus eat pork but not beef. The Russians eat beef but not sneaks. The Chinese eat snakes but not people. The Jale of New Guinea find people dilicious."

To sum up, **living in a different age or culture would make you different person. Even if you rebelled against the values of your time and place, they still would represent the context of your life-in other words, they still would influence your responses.**

### The influence of Ideas

**When an idea is expressed, closely related ideas are simutaneously conveyed, logically and inescapably.** In logic, this kinship is expressed by the term sequitur, Latin for "it follows."(The converse is non sequitur, "It does not follow.")

​	Consider, for example, the idea that many teachers and parents express to young children as a way of encounraging them: "If you beleive in yourself, you can succed at anything," From this is follows that nothing else but belief-neither talent nor hard work-is necessary for success, The reason the two ideas are equivalent that their meannings are inseparably linked.

​	**In addition to conveying ideas closely linked to it in meanning, an idea can imply other ideas.** For example, the idea that there is no real diffrence between virtue and vice implies that people should not feel bound by common moral standards. Samuel Johnson had this implication in mind when he said: "But if he does really think that there is no distinction between virtue and vice, why, Sir, when he leaves our houses let us count our spoons."【https://www.enotes.com/topics/life-samuel-johnson-ll-d/quotes/when-he-leaves-our-houses-let-us-count-our-spoons】

​	If we were fully aware of the closely linked meaning and implications of the ideas we encounter, we could easily sort out the sound ones from the unsound, the wise from the foolish, and the helpful from the harmful. But we are seldom fully aware. **In many cases, we take ideas at face value and embrace them with little or no thought of their associated meaninngs and implications. In the course of time, our actions are shaped by those meanings and implications, whether we are aware of them or not.**【语言、观点，影响说出去的话，表达的观点，看似讲给别人听，实际受影响最大的是我们自己】

To appreciate the influence of ideas in people's lives, consider the series of events set in motion by an idea that was popular in psychology more than a century ago and whose influence continues to this day-the idea that "intelligence is genetically determined and cannot be increased."

​	That idea led researchers to devise tests that measure intelligence. The most famous(badly flawed) test determined that the everage metal age og white American adults was 13 and that, among immigrants, the average Russian's mental was 11.34; the average Italian's, 11.01;the average Pole's, 10.74; and the average mental age of "Negroes,"10,41.

​	Educators read the text results and thought, "Attempts to raise students' intelligence are pointless," so they replaced academic curricula with vocaitonal curricula and embraced a methodology that taught student facts but not the process of judgement."

*The statement "Belief is oneself an important element in success" is very different because it specifies that belief is not the only element in success.*

Legislators read the test results and decided "We've got to do something to keep intellectually inferior people from entering the country," so they revised immigration laws to dicriminate against southern and centeral Europeans.

Eugenicits, who had long been concerned about the welfare of the human species, saw the tests as a grave warning. They thought, "If intellifence cannot be increased, we must find ways of encouraging reproduction among people of highter intelligence and discouraging it among those of lower intelligence."

The eugenicists' concern inspired a variety of actions. Margaret Sanger's Planned Parenthood urged the lower classes to practice contraception. Others succeded in legalizing promoted forced sterilizatioin, notably in Virginia. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Viginia law with Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. declaring, "Three generation of imbeciles are enough." Over the next five decades 7,500 women, including "unwed mothers, prostitutes, petty criminals and children with disciplinary problems" were streillized. In addition, by 1950 over 150, 000 supposedly "defective" children, many relatively normal, were held against their will in institutions. They "endured isolation, overcroding, forced labor, and physical abuse including lobotomy, electroshock, and surgical sterilization."

Meanwhile, businnes leaders read the test results and decided, "we need policies to ensure that workers leave their minds at the factory gate and perform their assigned tasks mindlessly." So they enacted those policies. Decades laterm when Edwards Deming proposed his "quality control" ideas for involving workers in decision making, business leaders remenbered those test results and ignored Deming's advice.(In contrast, the Japanese welcomed Deming's ideas; as a result, several of their industries surged ahead of their American competition.)

These are the most obvious effects of hereditarianism but they are certainly not the only ones. Others included discrimination against racial and ethnic minorities and the often-paternalistic policies of government offered in response. (Some historians also link hereditarianism to the genocide that occurred in Nazi Germany.)

**The innumerable ideas you have encountered will affect your beliefs and behavior in similar ways-sometimes slightly, at other times profoundly. And this can happen even if you have not consciously embraced the ideas.**

【我们在表达一个观点的时候，实际还传达了这个观点的隐藏含义。一个绝对观点的背后，是对这个观点反面的否定。

我们在生活中遇到的各种各样的观点，都会不同程度的影响我们的信念和行为。而且，即使你没有下意识（全然）接受这个观点的时候也一样。】

### The Influendce of Mass Culture

In centuries past, family and teachers were the dominant, and sometimes the only, influence on children. **Today, however, the influence exerted by mass culture  (the broadcast media, newspapers magazines, Internet and popular music) often is greater.**

​	By age 18 the average teenager has spent 11,000 hours in the classroom and 22,000 hours in front of the televisionset. He or she has had perhaps 13,000 school lessons yet has watched more than 750,000 commercials. By age thirty-five the same person had fewer than 20,000 school lessons yet has watched approximately 45,000 hours of television and close to 2 million commercials.

​	What effects does mass culture have on us? To answer, we need only consider the formats and devices commonly used in the media. Modern advertising typically bombards the public with slogans and testimonials by celebraties. **This approach is designed to appeal to emotions and create artificial needs for products and services**. As a reuslt, many people develop the habit of responding emotionally, impulsively, and gullibly to such appeals. They also tend to acquire values very different from thos taught in the home and the schoole. **Ads often portray play as more fulfilling that work, self-gratification as more desirable than self-control, and materialism as more meaningful than idealism.**

​	**Television programmers use frequent scene shifts and sensory appeals such as car crashes, violence, and sexual encounters to keep audience interest from dimishing.** Then they add frequent commercial interruptions. This author has analyzed the attention shifts that television viewers are subjected to. <u>In a dramatic program, for example, attention shifts might include camera angle changes; shifts in story line from one set of characters(or subplot) to another, or from a present scene to a past scene(flashback), or to fantasy; and shifts to "newsbreaks," to commercial breaks, from one commercial to another, and back to the program. Also included mights be shifts fo attention that occur within commercials.</u> The number of shifts within commercials ranged from 6 to 54 and averaged approximately 17 per fiftenn-second commercial. The total number of attention shifts came out to over 800 per hour, or over 14 per minute.

​	This manipulation has prevented many people from developing a mature attention span. They expect the classroom and the workplace to provide the same constnat excitement they get from televison. That, of course, is an impossible demand, and when it isn't met they call their teachers  boring and their work unfulfilling. Because such people seldom have the patience to read the books that require them to think, many publishers have replaces serious books with light fare written by celebreties.

​	Even when writers of serious books do manage to become published authors, they are often directed to give short, dramtic answers during promotional interviews, sometimes at the expense of accuracy. **A man who coach writers for talk shows offered one client this advice: "If I ask your whether the budget deficit is a good thing or a bad thing, you should not say, 'Well, it stimulates the economy but is passes on a burden.' You have to say 'It's a great idea!' or 'It's a terrible idea!' It doesn't matter which."** (*Translation: Don't give a balnacee answer. Give an oversimplified one because it will get you noticed.*)

​	Print journalism is also in the grip of sensationalism. As a newspaper editor obaserved, "Journalists keep trying to find people who are at 1 or at 9 scale of 1 to 10 rather than people at 3 to 7[the more moderate positions] where most people actually are." Another journalist claims, "**News is now becoming more opinion than verified fact.** Journalists are slipping into entertainment rather than telling us the verified facts we need to know."

​	Today's politicians often manipulate people more offensively than do journalists. Instead of expressing their thoughts, some politicians find out what people think and pretend to share their ideas. **Many politicians hire people to conduct polls and focus groups to learn what messages will "sell." They even go so far as to test the impact of certain words-that is why we hear so much about "trust", "familly", "character," and "values" these days.** Political science professor Larry Sabato says that during the Clinton impeachment trial, the president's advisors used the term private lives over and over-James Carville used it six times in one four-minute speech-because they knew it could persuade people into believing the president's lying under oath was of no great consequence.

过去，孩子们主要受父母和老师的影响，今天，各种媒体比如电视、广播、音乐、互联网成为主导。

这些媒体如何影响我们呢？商业广告通过各种方式刺激我们的感官、调动我们的情绪，是我们对商品和服务产生需求。这些广告总是告诉我们，享乐比工作更快乐，自我满足比自我控制更重要，物质主义比理想主义更有意义。

电视节目、现在的短视频，通过各种镜头切换来吸引人们的注意力。据有关统计，一个15s的视频，有6-54个平均17个镜头切换。

新闻正变得越来越倾向于阐述观点而不是描述事实。

甚至一些严肃书籍的作者，也开始尝试往畅销书作者改变。在追求短平快的过程中，他们夸大了一些事实，牺牲了一些准确性。

政客也一样，他们尝试用各种方式像人们兜售观点，以此来“操控”选民们的情绪。

### The "Science" of manipulation 

Attempts to influence the thoughts and actions of others are no doubt as old as time, but manipulation did not become a science util the early twentieth century, when **Ivan Pavlov, a Russian professor of psychology, published his research on conditioned(learned) reflexes.** Pavlov found that by ringing a bell when he fed a dog, he could condition the dog to drool at the sound of the bell even whtn no food was presented. An American psychologist, John Watson, was impressed with Pavlov's findings and applied them to human behavior. In Watson's  most famous experiment, he let a baby touch a laboratory rat. At first, the baby was unafraid. But then Watson hit a hammer against metal whenever the baby reached out to touch the rat, and the baby become frightened and cried. In time, the baby cried not only at the sight of the rat but also at the sight of anytthing furry, such as a stuffed animal. Watson's work earned him the title "father of behaviorism."

​	Less well known is Watson's application of behaviorist principle to advertising. He spent the latter part of his career working for advertising agencies and soon recognied that the most effecitve appeal to consumers was not to the mind but to the emotions. **He advised advertisers to "tell [the consumer] something that will tie hime up with fear, something that will stir up a mild rage, that will call out an affectionate or love response, or strike at a deep psychological or habit need."** His attitude toward the consumer is perhaps best indicated by a   statement he made in a presentation to department store executives: "The consumer is to the manufacturer, the department stores and the advertising agencies, what the green frog is to the physiologist."

​	Waton introduces these strategies in the 1920s and 1930s, the age of newspapers and raio. Since the advent of television, these advertising strategies have grown more sophisticated and effective, so much so that many individuals and groups with political and social agendas have adopted them. The strategies work for a number of reasons, the chief one being people's conviction that they are impervious to manipulation. This belief is mistaken, as many researchers have demonstrated. For example, Solomon Asch showed that people's reactions can be altered simply by changing the order of words in a serise. He asked study participants to evaluate a person by a series of adjectives. When he put positive adjectives first-"critical, stubborn, envious"-the particiapants gave a positive evaluation. When he reversed the order, with "envious" coming first and "intelligent" last, they gave a negative evaluation.

​	Similarly, research has shown that human memory can be manipulated. The way a question is asked can change the details a person's memory and even make a perpon *remember something that never happened.*

​	Of course, advertisers and people with political or social agendas are not content to stimulate emotions and /or plant ideas in our minds. They also seek to reindorce those impressions by repeating them again and again. The more people hear a slogan or talking point, the more familiar it becomes. Before long, it becomes indistinguishable from ideas developed through careful thought, Sadly, "the packaging is often done so effectively that the viewer, listener, or reader does not make up his own mind at all. Instead, he inserts a packaged opinion into his mind, somewhat like inserting a DVD into a DVD player. He then pushes a button and 'plays back' the opinion whenever it seems appropriate to do so. He has performed acceptably without having had to think." Many of the beliefs we hold dearest and defend most vigorously may have been planted in our minds in just this way.

​	Many years ago, Harry A. Overstreet noted that "a climate of opinion, like a physical climate, is so pervasive a thing those who live within it and know no other take it for granted." The rise of mass culture and the sophisticated use of manupulation have made this insight more relevant today than ever.'



### The Influence of Psychology

The social and psychological theories of our time also have an impact on our beliefs. Before the past few decades, people were urged to be self-disciplined, self-critical, and self-effacing. They were urged to practice self-denial, to asipire to self-knowledge, to behave in a manner that ensured they maintained self-respect. Self-centeredness was considered a vice. "Hard work," they were told, "leads to achievement, and that in turn produces satisfaction and self-confidence." By and large, our grandparents internalized those teachings. When they hornored them in their behavior, they felt pround; when they dishonored them, they felt ashamed.

​	Today the theries have been changed-indeed, almost exactly reversed. Self-esteem, which nineteenth-century satirist Ambrose Bierce defined as "an erroneous appraisement," is now considered an imperative. Self-centeredness has been transformed from vice into virtue, and people who devote their lives to helping others, people once considered heroic and saintlike, are now said to be afflicted with "a disease to please." The formula for success and happiness begins with feeling good about ourselves. Students who do poorly in school, workers who don't measure up to the challenges of theire jobs, substance abusers, lawbreakers-all are typically diagnosed as deficient in self-esteem.

In addition, just as our grandparents internalized the social and psychological theories of their time, so most contemporary Americans have internalized the message of self-esteem. We hear people speak of it over coffee; we heat it endlessly invoked on talk shows. Challengs to its precepts are usually met with disapproval.

​	But isn't the theory of self-esteem self-evident? No. A negative perception of our abilities will, of course, handicap our performance. Dr. Maxwe;; Maltz explains the amazing results one educator had in improving the grades of schoolchildren by chaning their self-images. The educator had observed that when the children saw themselves as stupid in a particular subject(or stupid in general), they unconsciously acted to confirm their self-images. They believed they were stupid, so they acted that way. Reasoning that it was undermining their efforts, the educator set out to change their self-images. He found that when he accomplished that, they no longer behaved stupidly! Maltz concludes from this and other examples that our expertiences can work a kind of self-hypnotism on us, suggesting a conclution about ourselves and then urging us to make it come true.

Many proponents of self-esteem went far beyond Maltz's demonstration that self-confidence is an important ingredient in success. They claimed that is no such thind as too much self-esteem. Research does not support that claim. For example, Martin Seligman, an eminent research psychologist and founder of the movement known as positive psychology, cites significant evidence that, rather than solving personal and social problems, including depression, the modern emphasis on self-esteem causes them.

​	Maltz's research documents that lack of confidence impedes performance, a valuable insight. But such research doesn't explain why the more global concept of self-esteem had become so dominant. The answer to that question lies in the popularization of the work of humanisitc psychologists such as Abraham Maslow. Maslow described what he called the hierarchy of human needs in the form of a pyramid, with physiological needs(food and drink) at the foundation. Above them, in ascending order, are safety needsm the need for belongingness and love, the need for esteem and approval, and aesthetic and congnitive needs(knowledge, understanding, etc.) At the pinnacle is the need for self-actualization, or fulfilment of our potential. In Maslow's view, the lower needs must be fulfilled before the higher ones. It's easy to see how the idea that self-esteem must precede achievement was dericed from Maslow's theory. 

​	Other theories might have been adopted, however. A notable one is Austrian psychiarist Viktor Frankl's, which was advanced at roughly the same time as Maslow's and was based on both Frankl's professional practice and his experiences in Hilter's concertration camps. Frankl argues that one huamn need is higher than self-actualization: self-transcendence, the need to rise above narrow absorption with self. According to Frankle, "the primordial anthropological fact [is] that being human is being always directed, and pointing to something or someone other than oneself: to a meaning to fulfill or another human being to encounter, a cause to serve or a person to love." A person becomes fully human "by forgetting himself and giving himself, overlooking himself and focusing outward."

​	Making self-actialization(or happiness) the direct object of out pursuit, in Frankl's view, is ultimately self-defeating; such fulfillment can occur only as "the unintended effect of self-transcendence." The proper perspective on life, Frankl believes, is not what it can give to us, but what is expects from us; life is daily-even hourly-questioning us, challenging us to accept "the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for [each of us]."

​	Finding meaning, according to Frankl's theory, involves "perceiving a possibility embedded in reality" and searching for challenging tasks "whose completion might add meaning to [one's] existence." But such perceiving and searching are frustrated by the focus on self: "As long as modern literature confines itself to, and contents itself with, self-expression-not to say self-exhibition-it reflects its authors' sense of futility and absurdity. What is more important, it also creates absurdity. **This is understandable in light of the fact that meaning must be discovered,** it cannot be invented. Sense cannot be created, but what may well be created is nonsense."

​	Whether we agree completely with Frankl, one thing is clear: Contemporary American culture would be markedly different if the emphasis over the past several decades had been on Frankl;s theory rather than on the theories of Maslow and the other humanistic psychologists. All of would have been affected- we can only imagine how profoundly-in out attitude, values, and beliefs. 

### Becoming an Individual

In light of what we have discussed, we should regard individuality not as something we are born with but rather as something acquired-or, more precisely, earned. Individuality begins in the realization that it is impossible to escape being influence by other people and by circumstance. The essence of individuality is vigilance. The following guidelines will help to achieve this:

1. **Treat your first reaction to any person, issue, or situation as tentative.** No matter how appealing it may be, refuse to embrace it until you have examined it.

   把你对任何人、任何观点、任何情况的第一反应当作是尝试性的，无论它多么吸引人，在你审视它之前，不要盲目接受它。

2. **Decide why you reacted as you did.** Conside whether you borrowed the reaction from someone else-a parent or friend, perhaps, or a celebrity or fictional charactoer on television. If possible, determine what specific experiences conditioned you to react this way.

   思考你为什么会这么反应。是不是你从其他人那里借鉴而来——比如你的父母、朋友、名人或者电影中的虚构角色。

3. **Think of other possible reactions you might have had to the person, issue, or situation.** 

   思考你在面对这些人、观点、情况的时候，是否可能有其他反应，

4. **Ask youself whether one of the other reactions is more appropriate than your first reaction.** And when you answer, resist the influence of your conditioning. 

   问问自己，哪个反应会比你的第一反应更适合（当时的状况）。

To ensure that you will really be an individual and not merely claim to be one, apply thest guidelines throughout your work in this book, as well as in your everyday life. 

### Applications

*Note: One of the best ways to develop your thinking(and writing) skills is records your observations, questions, and ideas in a journal and then, as time permits, to reflect on what you have recorded-considering the meaning and application of the observation, answering the questions, elaborating on the ideas(and, where appropriate, challenging them), and recording your insights. An inexpensive bound notebook or spiral notebook will serve the purpose. A good approach is to record your initial observations, questions and ideas on the left side of the page, leaving the right side blank for your later analysis and commentary. The value of this reflective process is so great that you should consider keeping such a journal even if your instructor does not make is a formal part of the course.*

1. Do a bried study of attention shifts such as the one described in the chapter. Record a half-hour show. Then play the show back twice, the first time counting the number of shifts within the program, excluding commercials, and the second time counting only those within commercials. Complete the necessary arithmetic and be prepared to share your results in class.

2. Reflect on your findings in application 1. Write several paragraphs discussing the implications of those findings for education, business, and family life.

3. Many people cheerfully pay \$6 or \$7 a gallon for designer drinking water but moan and groan when they have to pay \$3 a gallon for gasoline. Does anythind you read in this chapter help you understand why this is so?

   我想，这里说的6-7美元的特制水，应该就是可乐或者其他软饮料。

   首先，因为我们身处在一个商业极速发展的时代。这些软饮料的商家都是营销大师，他们让我们相信，这些软饮料能带来快乐，甚至能带来营养。而汽油是给汽车喝的，没法直接给我们带来快乐。

   因为作者在美国，汽车是他们不可或缺的交通工具。每天都要花费的钱，单价相对低，但是他们消耗的量大。

   商家总是告诉我们：

   Ads often portray play as more fulfilling than work, self-gratification as more desirable than self-control, and materialism as more meaningful than idealism.

4. Imagine how different America might be if Frankl's emphasis on self-transcendence and personal responsibility, rather than Maslow's emphasis on self-actualization and popular culture's emphasis on self-esteem, had been dominant for the past fifty years. List as many ways as you can in which our society might be different today and comment on whether each would be beneficial or harmful. Be prepared to explain your views in class discussion.

5. Watch one of the music video channels-MTV, VH1, CMT, BET-for at least an hour, Analyze how men and women depicted in the videos. Note significant details. For example, observe whether men are depicted in power roles more than women and whether women are portray as objects of male desire. **Decide what attitudes and values are conveyed.** （You might have to record as you are watching so that you can review what you have seen, freeze significant frames for closer analysis, and keep your observations for later reference or class viewing and discussion.)

6. Suppose you asked a friend, "How did you acquire your particular identiry-your sentiments and preferences and attitudes?" Then suppose the friend responded, "I'm an individual. No one else influences me. I do my own thing, and I select the sentiments and preferences and attitudes that suit me." How would you explain to your friend what you learned in this chapter.

7. Ask yourself the question, Who am I? Write down ten answers to this question, each on a separate slip of paper. Use the first three paragraphs of this chapter to help you frame your answers. Arrange the pieces of paper in order of their importance to you. Then explain the arrangement-that is, which self-descriptions are most important to you, why?

8. Identify the various positive and negative influences that have shaped you. Be sure to include the particular as well as the general and the subtle as well as the obvious influences. Which of thos influences have had the greatest effect on you? Explain the effects as precisely as you can.

9. Note your immediate reaction to each of the following statements. Then apply the four guidelines given in this chapter for achieving individuality.

   - Heal care workers should be required to be children should banned.
   - 

10. Group discussion exercise:



### A Differentce of Opinion

The following passage summarizes an important difference of opinion. After reading the statement, use the library and/or the Internet and find what knowledgeable people have said about the issue. Be sure to cover the entire range of views. Then assess the strengths and weaknesses of each. If you conclude that one view if entirely correct and the others are mistaken, explain how you reached that conclusion. If, as is more likely, you find that one view is more insightful that the others but that they all make some valid points, construct a view of your own that combines insights from all viewd and explain why that view is the most reasonable of all. Present your response in a composition or an oral report, as your instuctor specifies.

## What is Critical Thinking?

When Arthur was in the first grade, the teacher directed the class to "think." "Now, class," she said, "I know this problem is a little harder than the ones we've been doing, but I'm going to give you few extra minutes to think about it, Now start thinking."

……

Your experience may have been similar to Arthur's. In other words, many people may have simply told you to think without ever explaining what thinking is and what qualities a good thinker has that a poor thinker lacks. If that is the case, you have a lot of company. Extensive, effective training is thinking is the exception rather than the trule. This fact and its unfortunate consequences are suggested by the following commnets from accomplished observers of the human conditio:

> The most interesting and astounding contradiction in life if to me the constant insistence by nearly all people upon "logic," "logic reasoning," "sound reasoning," on the  one hand, and on the other their inability to display it, and their unwillingness to accept it when displayed by others.
>
> Most of our so-called reasoning consists in finding arguments for going on believing as we already do.
>
> Clear thinking is a very rare thing, but even just plain thinking is almost as rare. Most of us most of the time do not think at all. We believe and we feel, but we do not think.
>
> Mental idolence is one of the commonest of human traits.

​	What is this activity that everyone claims is important but few people have mastered? Thinking is general term used to cover numerous activities, from daydreaming to reflection and analysis. Here are just some of the synonyms listed in Roget's Thesaurus for think:

> appreciate 
>
> ……

### Mind, Brain, or Both?

Most modern researchers use the word mind synonymously with brain, as if the physical organ that resides in the human skull were solely responsible for thinking. This practice conveniently presupposes that a problem that has challenged the greatest thinkers for millennia-the relationship between mind and physical matter-was shomhow solved when no one was looking. The  problem itself and the individuals who spent their lives wrestling with it deserve better.

​	Neuroscience has provided a number of valuable insights into the cognitive or thinking activities of the brain. It has documented that the left hemisphere of the brain deals mainly with detailed language processing and is associated with analysis and logical thinking, that the right hemisphere deals mainly with sensory images and is associated with intuition and creative thinking, and that the small bundle of nerves that lies between the heimspheres-the corpus callosum-integrates the various functions.

​	The research that produced these insights showed that the brain is necessary for thoughts, but it has not shown that the brain is sufficient for thought. In fact, many philosophers claim it can never show that. They argue that the mind and the brain are demonstrably different. Whereas the brain is a physical entity composed of matter and therefore subject to decay, the mind is a metaphysical entity. Examine brain cell under the most powerful microscope and you will never see an idea or concept-for example, beauty, governement, equality, or love-because ideas and concepts are not material entities and so have no physical dimension. Where, then, do these nonmaterial things reside? In the nonmaterial mind.

​	The late American philosopher Wiliam Barret observaed that "histtory is, fundamentally, the adventure of  human consciousness" and "the fundamnetal history of humankind is the history of mind." In his view, "one of the supreme ironier of modern history" is the fact that science, which owes its very existence to the human mind, has had the audacitu to deny the reality of the mind. As he put it, "the offspring denies the parent."

​	The argument over whether the mind is reality is not the only issue about the mind that has hotly debated over the centuries. One especially important issue is whether the mind is passive, a blank slate on which experience writes, as John Locke held, or active, a vehicle by which we take the initiative and exercise our free will, as G. W. Leibnitz argued. This book is based on the latter view.

### Critical Thinking Defined

Let's begin by making the important distinction between thinking adn feeling. I feel and I think are sometimes used interchangeably, but that practice causes confusion. Feeling is subjective response that reflects emotion, sentiment, or desire; it generally occurs spontaneously rather that through a conscious mental act. We don't have to employ our minds to feel angry when we are insulted, afraid when we are threatened, or compassionate when we see a picture of starving child. The feelings arise automatically.

​	Feeling is useful in directing our attention to matters we should think about; it also can provide the enthusiasm and commitment necessary to complete arduous mental tasks. However, feeling is never a good subtitute for thinking because it is notoriously unreliable. Some feelings are benefical, honorable, even noble; others are not, as everyday experience demonstrates. We often feel like doing things that will harm us-for example, smoking, sunbathing without sunscreen, telling off our professor or employer, or spending the rent money on lottery tickets.

​	Zinedine Zidane was one of the greatest soccer players of his generation, and mant experts believed that in his final season(2006) he would lead Frane to the pinnacle of soccer succes-winning the coveted World Cup. But then, toward the end of the championship game against Italy, he viciously head-butted an Italien player in full view of hundreds of millions of people. The referee banished him from the field, France lost the match, and a single surrender to feeling forever stained the brilliant career Zidane had dedicated his life to building.

​	In contrast to feeling, thinking is a conscious mental process performed to solve a problem, make a decision, or gain understanding. Whereas feeling has no purpose beyond expressing itself, thinking aims beyond itself to knowledge or action. This is not to say that thinking is infalliable; in fact, a good part of this book is devoted to exposing errors in thinking and showing you how to avoid them. Yet for all its shorcomings, thinking is the most reliable guide to action we humans possess. To sum up the relationship betweem feeling and thinking, feelings need to be tested before being trusted, and thinking is the most reasonable and reliable way to test them.

​	There are three brooad categories of thinking: reflective, creative, and critical. The focus of this book is on critical thiking. The essence of critical thinking is **evaluation**. **Critical thinking, therefore, may be defined as the process by which we test claims and arguments and determine which have merit and which do not.** In other words, **critical thinking is a search for answers, a quest**. Not surprisingly, one of the most important techniques used in critical thinking is asking probing questions. Where the uncritical accept their thoughts and other people's statements as face value, **critical thinkers challenge all ideas in this manner:**

| Thought                                                      | Question                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Professor Vile cheated me in my composittion grade. He weighted some themes more heavily than others. | Did he grade everyone on the same standard? Were the different weightings justified？ |
| Before women enter the work force, there were fewer divorces. That show taht a woman's place in the home. | How do you know that this factor, and not some other one(s), is reponsible for the increase in divorces? |
| A college education isn't worth what you pay for it. Some people never reach a salary level appreciably higher than the level they would have reached without the degree. | Is the money the only measure of the worth of an education? What about increased understanding of self and life and increased ability to cope with challenges? |

​	**Critical thinking also empoys questions to analyze issues**. Consider, for example, the subject of values. When it is being discussed, some people say "Our country has lost its traditional values" and "There would be less crime, especially violent crime, if parents and teachers emphasized moreal values." Critical thinking would prompt us to ask, 

1. What is the relationship between values and beliefs? Between values and convictions?
2. Are all values valuable?
3. How aware is the average person of his or her values? Is it possible that many people deceive themselves about their real values？
4. Where do one's values originate? Within the individual or outside? In thought or in feeling?
5. Does education  change a person's values? If so, is this change always for the best?
6. Should parents and teachers attempt to shape children's values?



### Characteristics of Critical Thinkers

Miconceptions about critical thinking:

- Being able to support beliefs with reasong mmakes one a critical thinker.
  - The test of critical thinking is whether the reasons are good and sufficient.
- critical thinkers never imitate others in thought or action
  - critical thinking means making sound decisions, regardless of how common or uncommon thos decisions are.
- critical thinking is synonymous with having a lot of right answers in one's head.
  - critical thinking involves the process of finding answers when they are not so readily available.
- critical thinking cannot be learned, that one either has it or does not.
  - critical thinking is matter of habit

characteristics of critical thinkers:

- skill in asking apporpriate questions
- control's of one's mental activities
  - John Dewey: more of our time tthan most of us are to admit is spent "trifling with mental pictures, random recollections, pleasant but unfounded hopes, flitting, half-developed impressions." Good thinkers are no exception. However, they have learned better than poor thinkers how to stop that casual, semiconscious frift of images when they wish and how to fix their minds on one specific matter, examine it carefully, and form a judgement about it.

- some additional characteristics of critical thinkers

  | Critical Thinkers                                            | Uncritical Thinkers                                          |
  | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | Are honest with themselves, acknowledging what they don't know, recognizing their limitations, and being watchful of their own errors. | Pretend they know more than they do, ignore their limitations, and assume their views are error-free. |
  | Regard problems and controversial issues as exciting challenges. | Regard problems and controversial issues as nuisances or threats to their ego. |
  | Strive for understanding, keep cuiosity alive, remain patient with complexity, and ready to invest time to overcome confusion. | Are impatient with complexity and thus would rather remain confused that make the effort to understand. |
  | Base jugments on evidence rather than personal preferences, deferring judgement whenever evidence is insufficient. They revise judgement when new evidence reveals error. | Base judgments on first impressions and gut reactions. They are unconcerned about the amount or quality of evidence and cling to their views steadfastly. |
  | Are interested in other people's ideas and so are willing to read and listen attentively, even when they tend to disagree with the other person. | Are preoccupied with themselves and their own opinions and so are unwilling to pay attention to other's views. At the first sign of disagreement, they tend to think, "How can I refute this?" |
  | Recognize that extreme views(whether conservation or liberal) are seldom correct, so they avoid them, practice fairmindedness, and seek a balances view. | Ignore the need for balance and give preference to views that suppoer their established views. |
  | Practice restraint, controlling their feelings rather than being controlled by them, and thinking before acting. | Tend to follow their feelings and act impulsively.           |

  As the disirable qualities suggest, critical thinking depends on mental discipline. **Effective thinkers exert control over their mental life, direct their thoughts rather than being directed by them, and withhold  their endorsement of any idea-even their own-until they have tested and confirmed it**. John Dewey equated this mental discipline with freedom. That is he argued that people who do not have it are not free persons but slaves to whim or circumstance:

> If a man's actions are not guided by thoughtful conclusions, then they are guided by inconsiderate impulse, unbalanced appetite, caprice, or the circumstances of the moment. To cultivate unhindered, unreflective external activity is the foster enslavement, for it leaves the person at the mercy of appetite, sense, and circumstance.

### The Role of Intuition

**Intuition is comonly defined as immediate perception or comprehension of something-that is, sensing or understanding something without the use of reasoning.** Some everyday experiences seem to support this definition. You may have met a stranger and instantly "known" that you would be partners for life. When a cat salesman told you that the price he was quoting you was his final, rock-bottom price, your intuition may have told you he was lying. 

……

Such examples seem to suggest that intuition is very different from reasoning and is not influenced by it. But before accepting that conclusion consider these facts:

> Breakthrough ideas favor trained, active minds. It is unsusual for someone totally untrained in a subject to make a signigicant new discovery about it. Thus if Kekule had been a plumber, Goethe a bookeeper, and Coleridge a haidresser, they would almost certainly not have received the intuitions fot which they are famous.
>
> Some intuitions eventually prove to mistaken. That attractiove stranger may turn out to be not your lifelong partner but a person for whom you develop a strong dislike. The car salesman's final price may have proved to be exactly that. And instead of doing poorly in that course, you may have done well.
>
> It is difficult to make an overall assessment of the quality of our intuitions because we tend to forget the ones that prove mistaken in much the same way a gambler forgets his losses.

​	These facts have led some scholars to conclude that intuitions is simply a consequence of thinking. They would say that something about the stranger appealed to you, something the salesman said or did suggested insincerity, something about the professor frightened you. In each case, they would explain, you made a quick decision-so quick, in fact, that you were unaware that you'd been thinking. In the case of the breakthrough ideas, the scholars would say that when people become engrossed in problems or issues, their unconscious minds often continue working on them long after they have turned their attention elsewhere. Thus, when an insight seems to come "out of nowhere", it is actually a delayed result of thinking.

​	Which view of intuitions is the correct one? Are intuitions different from the independent of thinking or not? Pherhaps, for now, the most prudent answer is that sometimes they are independent and sometimes they are not; we can't be sure when they are, and therefore it is imprudent to relay on them.

### Basic Acitivities in Critical Thinking 

The basic activities in critical thinking are **investigation, interpretation, and judgement,** in that order. The following chart summarizes each activity in relation to the other two.

| Activity       | Definition                                                   | Requirements                                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Investigation  | Finding evidence-that is, data that wil answer key questions about the issue | The evidence must be both relevant and sufficient.           |
| Interpretation | Deciding what the evidence means                             | The interpretation must be more reasonable that competing interpretations. |
| Judgement      | Reaching a conclusion about the issue                        | The conclusion must meet the test of logic.                  |

​	As we noted previously, irresponsible thinkers first choose their conclsions and then seek out evidence to jusify their choices. They fail to realize that the only conclusion worth drawing is one based on a thorought understanding of the problem or issue and ts possbile solutions or resolutions. Is it acceptable to speculate, guess, and form hunches and hypotheses? Absolutely. Such activities provide a helpful starting point for the thinking process. (Beisides, we couldn't avoid doing so even if we tried,) The crucial thing is not to let hunches and hypotheses mainpulate our thinking and dictate our conlusion in advance.

### Critical Thinking and Writing

Writing may be used for either of two broad purpopses: to discover ideas or to communicate them. Mostt of the writing you have done in school is undoubtedly the latter kind. But the former can be very helpful, not only is sorting out ideas you've already produces,  but laso in stimulating the flow of new ideas. For some reason, the very act of writing down one idea seems to generate additional ideas.

​	Whenever you write to discover ideas, focus on the issue you are examinng and record all your thoughts, questions, and assertions. Don't worry about organization or correctness. If ideas come slowly, be patient. If they come suddenly, in a rush, don't try to slow down the process and develop any one of them; simply jot them all down.(There will be time for elaboration and correction later.) Direct your mind's effort, but be sensitive ot ideas on the fringe of consciouness. Often they, too, will prove valuable. 

​	If you have done your discovery wrinting well and have thought critically about the ideas you have produced, the task of writing to communicate will be easier and more enjoyable. You will have many more ideas-carefully evaluated ones-to develop and organize.

### Criticak Thinking and Discussion

As its best, discussion deepens understanding and promotes problem solving and descision making. At its worst, it frays nerves, creates animosity, and leaves important issues unrsolved. Unfortunately, the most prominent models for discussion in contemporary culture-radio and TV talk shows-often produce the latter effects.

​	Many hosts demand that their guests answer complex questions with simple "yes" or "no" answers. If the guests respond that way, they are attcked for oversimplifying. If instead, they try to offer a balanced answer, the host shouts, "You're not answering the question," and proceeds to answer it himseld. Guests who agree with the host are treated warmly; others are debating, each takes a turn interrupting while the other shouts, "Let me finish." Neither shows any desire to learn fro the other. Typically, as the show draws to a close, the host thanks the paticipants for a "vigorous debate" and promises the audience more of the same next time.

​	Here are some simple guidelines for ensuring that the discussions you engage in-in the classroom, on the job or at home-are more civil, meaningful, and productive than what you see on TV. By following these guidelines, you will set a good example for the people around you.

​	**Whenever possible, prepare in advance.** Not every discussion can be prepared for in advance, but many can. An agenda is usually circulated several days before a businness or committee meeting. In college courses, the assignment schedule provides a reliable indication of what will be discussed in class on a given day. Use this information to prepare: Begin by reflecting on what you already know about the topic. Then decide how you can expand your knowledge and devote some time to doing so.(Fifteen or twenty minutes of focused searching in the library or on the Internet can produce a significant amout of information on almost any subject.) Try to anticipate the different points of view that might be expressed in the discussion and consider the relative merits of each. Keep your conclusions tentative at this point, so that you will be open to the facts and interpretations others will present.

​	**Set reasonable expectations**. Have you ever left a discussion disppointed that others hadn't abandoned their views and embraced yours? Have you ever felt offended when someone disagreed with you or asked you what evidence you had to support your opinion? If the answer to either question is yes, you probaly expect too much of others. People seldom change their minds easily or quickly, particularly in the case of long-held convictions. And when they encouter ideas that differ from their own, they naturally want to know what evdience supports those ideas. Expect to have your ideas questioned, and be cheerful and gracious in responding.

​	**Leave egotism and personal agendas at the door.** **To be productive, discussion requires and atomsphere of mutual respect and civility.** Egotism produces disrespectful attitudes toward others-notably, "I'm more important that other people," "My ideas are better than anyone else's," and "Rules don't apply to me." Personal agendas, such as dislike for another participant or excessive zeal for a point of view, can lead to personal attacks and unwillingness to listen to others' views. 

​	**Contribute but don't  dominate.** If you are the kind of person who loves to talk and has a lot to say, you probably contribute more to discussions than other participants. On the other hand, if you are more reserved, you may seldom say anything. There is nothing wrong with being either kind of person. However, dicussions tend to be most productive when everyone contributes ideas. For this to happen, loquacious people need to exercise a little restraint, and more reserved people need to accept responsibility for sharing their thoughts.

​	**Avoid distrcting speech mannerisms.** Such mannerisms include starting one sentence and then abruptly switching to another; mumbling or slurring your words; and puncuating everty phrase or clause with audible pauses("um," "ah,") or meaningless expressions("like," "you know," "man"). These annoying mannerisms distract people from your message. To overcome them, listen to yourself when you speak. Even better, tape your conversations with friends and family(with their permission), then play the tape back and listen to yourself. Whenever you are engaged in a discussion, aim for clarity, directness, and economy of expression.

​	**Listen actively.** When the paticipants don't listen to one another, discussion becomes little more than serial monologue-each person talking a turn at speaking while the rest ignore what is being said. This can happen quite unintentionally because the mind can process ideas faster than the fatest speaker can deliver them. Your mind may get tired of waiting and wander about aimlessly like a dog off its leash. In such cases, instead of listening to the speaker's words, you may think about her clothing or hairstyle or look outside the window and observe what is happenning there. Even when you make a serious effort to listen, it is easy to lose focus. If the speacker's words trigger an unrealted memory, you may slip away to that earlier time  and place. If the speaker says something you disagree with, you may begin framing a reply. The best way to maintain your attention is to be alert for such distrctions and to resist them. Strive to enter the speacker's frame of mind, understand what is said, and connect it with what was said previously. Whenever you realize your mind is wandering, drag it back to the taks.

​	**Juge iudeas responsibly.** Ideas range in quality from profound to ridiculous, helpfu to harmful, ennobling to degrading. It is therefore appropriate to pass judgement on them. However, faireness demands that you base your judgment on thoughtful consideration of the overall strengths and weaknesses of the ideas, not on initial impressions or feelings. Be especially careful with ideas that are unfamiliare or different from your own  because those are the ones you will be most inclined to deny a faire hearing.

​	**Resist the urge to shout or interrupt.** No doubt you understand that shouting and interrupting are rude and disrespectful behaviors, but do you realize that in many cases they are also a sign og intellectual insecutity? It's true. If you really believe your ideasa are sound, you will have no need to raise your voice or to silence the other person. Even if the other person resorts to such behavior, the best way to demonstrate confidence and charatcter is by refusing to reciprocate. Make it your rule to disagree without being disagreeable.

### Avoiding Plagiarism

Once ideas are put into words and published, they become intellectual property, and the author has the same rights over them as he or she has over a material possession such as a
