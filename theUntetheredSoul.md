## introduction

"This above all: to thine own self be true, and it must follow, as the night the day, thou canst not then be false to any man."-William Shakespeare

Shakespeare's age-honored words, spoken by Polonius to his son Laertes in Act I of Hamlet, sound so clear and unambiguous. **They tell us that to maintain honest relations with others we must first be true to ourselves**. Yet if Laertes were to be totally honest with himself, he would realize that his father may as well have told him to catch the wind. After all, to which "self" are we to be true? Is it the one shows up when we're in a bad mood, or the one that is present when we feel humbled by our mistakes? Is it the one who speaks from the dark recesses of the heart when we're depressed or upset, or the one that appears during those fleeting moments when life seems so fanciful and light?

​	From these questins we see that the concept of "self" may turn  out to be a bit more elusive than initially present presumed. Perhaps if Laertes could have turned to traditional psychology, it would have shed some light on the subject. Freud(1927), the father of psychology, divided the psyche into thress parts: the id, the ego, and the superego. He saw the id as out primal, animal nature; the superego as the judgement system that society has instilled within us; and the ego as our reopresentative to the outside world that struggles to maintain a balance between the other two powerful forces. But this certainly would not have helpled young Laertes. After all, to which of these conflicting forces as we to be true?

​	Again we see that thing are not always as simple as they seem. If we dare to look past the surface of the term "self", questions arise that many people would rather not ask: "Are the many aspects of my being equally prt of my 'self,' or is there only one of me-and if so, which, where, how, and why?"

​	In the following chapters, we will undertake a journey of exploration of "self." But we will not do so in a traditional manner. We will neither call upon the experts in psychology, nor upon the great philosophers. We will not argue and choose between time-hornored religious views, or resort to statistically supported surveys of peoples's opinions. We will, instead, turn to a single source that has phenomenal direct knowledge on the subject. We will turn to on expert who, for every moment of every day of their life, has been collecting the data necessary to finally put his greate inquiry to rest. And that expert is you.

​	But before you get too excited, or decide that you're not up to the task, first be clear that we're not after your views or opionions on the subject. Neither are we interested in what books you have read, classes you have taken, nor seminars you have attended. We are only interested in your intuitive experience of what it is like to be you. We are not looking for your knowledge; we are seeking your direct experience. You see, you can't fail at this because your "self" is what you are, at all times and in all places. We simply need to sort is out. After all, it can get quite confusing in there.

​	The chapters of this book are nothing but mirrors for seeing your "self" form different angles. And thought th journer we are aboout to embark on is an inner one, it will draw upoom  every aspect of your like. The only requirement asked of you is the willngness to honsetly look at yourself in the most natural, intuitive manner. Remember, if we are seeking the root of "self", what we are actually seeking is you.

​	As you read through these pages, you will find that you know much more than you thought you did about some very deep subjects. The fact is, you already know how to find yourself; you have just gotten distracted an disoriented. Once refocused, you will realize that you not only have the ability to find yourself, you have the ability to free yourself. Whether you choose to do so or not is entirely up to you. But upon completion of your journey through these chapters, there will be no more confusion, no more lack of empowerment, and no more blaming others. You will know exactly what must be done. And should you choose to devote yourself to the ongoing journey of self-realization, you will develop a tremendous sense of respect for who you really are. It is only then that you will come to appreciate the full depth of meaning in the advice: "This above all: to thine own self be true."



## the voice inside your head

"Shoot, I can't remember her name. What is her name? Darn, here she comes. What is it... Sally... Sue? She just told me yesterday. What's the matter with me? This is going to embarrassing."

In case you haven't noticed, you have a mental dialogue going on inside your head that never stops. It just keeps going and going. Have you ever wondered why it takes in there? How does it decide what to say and when to say it? How much of what it says turns out to be true? How much of what it says is even important? And if right now you are hearing, "I don't know what you're talking about. I don't have any voice inside my head!"-that's the voice we're talking about.

​	If you're smart, you'll take the time to step back, examine this voice, and get to know it better. The problem is you're too close be objective. You have to step way back and watch it converse. While you're driving, you hear internal conversations like,

​	"Wasn't I supposed to call Fred? I should have. Oh my God, I can't believe I forgot! He's going to be so mad. He may never talk to me again. Maybe I should stop and call him right now. No. I don't want to stop the car right now..."
