## 4.4 知道做到之间的距离

1. **你做到了哪些你知道的道理？**

   - 坚持读书，提升认知
   - 多陪家人
   - 定投BOX

2. **你是如何做到的？**
   定投。

   一种是主动定投：比如看书、健身、陪家人。

   另一种是主动地选择被动，比如定投BOX

   其实在主动定投的过程中，也会采用一些“被动”策略，比如提前给自己制定看书时间，到点了就看书。

   我一般早上起来冥想、看书打卡，如果早上没看完就中午午休的时候看。

3. **对于那些你已经知道而且想做到的事，你该如何做到？**

   和投资一样。如果刚进入这个领域，找到在这个领域长期成功的人，盲从他们的选择，然后持续定投。

4. **你印象深刻的⼀句话是哪句话？**

**Knowing** is one thing, **doing** is another. 

知道是一回事，做到又是另外一回事。

If even simple knowledge can be this difficult, taking a long time to finally master, then what about more complex knowledge? It can take even longer.

如果掌握简单的知识都需要花很长时间，那么面对更难的知识呢？自然要花更久的时间。

My goal was clear, so reading the book gave me more pleasure than pain. By the time I finished I felt like an entirely new person! But that was an illusion, because I quickly discovered that I still frequently fell for logical fallacies. In retrospect, this is not surprising, since every logical fallacy has countless iterations. 

我的目标很清晰(希望自己能顾独立思考)，所以读这本书（《超越感觉》）给我更多的快乐而不是痛苦。读完这本书，我觉得自己已经焕然一新！可那只不过是幻觉，自己还是那么经常地掉入各种已知逻辑陷阱——也难怪，几乎每一个常见的逻辑陷阱都有无数的变体。

Slowly, this book became the book that I would re-read the most times over the course of my life. 

自然而然地，这本书成了我这一生中重复阅读次数最多的书籍。

The mirror effect is ubiquitous, though, and this book that has had a huge impact on my life is [trash](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3S1K0E2LMJE8V/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0078038189) in the eyes of some.

镜像效应再次出现了， 这本我阅读次数最多对我影响最大的书籍，在很多人眼里竟然是垃圾……

Every once in a while I will discover that I have once again fallen for a logical fallacy that I thought I had already taught myself to avoid.

每隔一段时间就会发现，自己在明明早已经知道的情况下，还是再一次掉进了同样的陷阱……

因为：

> More than 130 common cognitive biases have been identified, and I'm sure many more will be discovered.

（我们有非常多的认知偏差）科学家已经发现已经超过130种认知偏差了，我相信还会有更多。

> Your past decisions necessarily lack your current rich experience.

你过去的决策必然缺乏当下的经验。

> You need to get started no matter what, and you learn as you go.
>
> Love, marriage, parenting, and even birth are all like this. 

无论如何你都得开始，然后边走边学。

Another example of not becoming aware of the mirror effect until it's too late is the phenomenon of people regretting in old age not working harder earlier in life.

 It's easy to see in hindsight, but when most people are young they are unable to see the true importance of gaining knowledge. Their decisions are based upon independent thinking without broad experience, like a frog in the bottom of a well.

> Regular investing gives practitioners a long period to learn, observe, practice and make corrections. A period of at least two full cycles, which is long enough for anyone to cross the gap between knowing and doing.

After two full cycles, they have enough knowledge and experience to make quality decisions without regret.

> **The earlier the mistake the greater the long-term cost**, because the cost is compounded over the long term.

Regular investors are fortunate because they do the right thing from the start, and as long as they keep doing it for two full cycles they can't make a mistake.

there are only two things they need to do: 1) constantly strengthen their ability to make money outside of the market, and 2) more importantly, constantly learn about investing, patiently crossing the gap between knowing and doing.
